Tired of endlessly clicking through font dropdowns in your design software? Or waiting for slow, ad-filled web tools to load? We were too.

**FontMuse** is a simple, free desktop utility built to solve one problem: making font discovery and previewing fast, easy, and efficient. It scans all the fonts on your system and displays them instantly with your own custom text. No lag, no internet required, just pure performance.
